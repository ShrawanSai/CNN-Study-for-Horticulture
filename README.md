<h1> FlowerSpeciesClassification </h1>

<h3> Project aim </h3> • Develop a flower classification system using deep learning techniques to aid botanists, agriculturists, and horticulturists in identifying different species of flowers.<br>
<h3> Methodology </h3> • Building deep-learning-based classification models using a combination of state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. <br>
 <h3> Challenges </h3>
    • Differences in image qualities within the dataset. <br>
    • Data quality issues, where some images contained text or the flower was not the most prominent part of the image. <br>
<h3> Goals </h3>
    • Explore and provide a detailed analysis of how different CNN architectures and combinations fare against the chosen datasets of flowers. <br>
    • Compare all eleven models that were trained. <br>
    • Provide a detailed performance analysis. <br>

<h3>Dataset-1 </h3> 
  • It has 7 evenly balanced classes with 1600 images per class (11200 total images). However, we pruned the number of classes to 5 making the total images to 8000(to maintain a diverse number of classes per dataset). 

<h3>Dataset-2 </h3> 
  • It has 10 evenly distributed classes with 1500 images per class (15000 total images).

<h3>Dataset-3 </h3> 
  • It has 16 classes unevenly distributed with a total of 15,740 images. There are 980 images on average per class in Dataset-3 where the number of images per class fell in the range of 737-1054. <br> <br>
